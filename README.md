## Concept

We decided to make a game based off of fairy tales, in which those fairy tales are linked together and you can traverse between them during the course of the game.
As you play, you will make choices that will impact future opportunities and your score, and you will collect items to help you in certain situations. However, every item only has one use - once you use it, it's gone for good. A sword? Shattered upon impact. A rock? lost once thrown.

Navigate your way through the various twisted fairy tales................
