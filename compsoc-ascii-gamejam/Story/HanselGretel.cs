        As you approach your granny's house you see 2 children in the upstairs window. Confused you speed up your pace slightly in order to make sure your granny is okay as you've
        never seen these children before. You walk in to see your granny with her head in the oven and the little boy about to shove her in. Do you "run" off to go get help, begin 
        trying to "talk" to the children and find out what they're doing, or do you immediately go to "fight" in order to protect your poor frail old granny?

        *GET USER INPUT*

        IF RUN
            You run away to go and get help for you granny. By the time you return she is gone, and the children are nowhere to be seen. You stare in shock unable to believe what
            has just occured and question if you made the right choice. 

            *GAME END, THIS IS THE TRUE ENDING TO HANSEL AND GRETEL THAT YOU HAVE JUST DISCOVERED*

        IF TALK
        
        The kids begin to explain to you that your granny was going to eat them. You stare at them, and look between them and your sweet frail old granny unsure who to believe.
        Do you believe the kids?

        IF YES

            You stand there mortified as the kids finish their story, about what your granny had done. This causes you to run away in shock and go home explaining what just happened
            to your mother who while suspicious doesn't press you or lecture you about lying.

        IF NO
        
            You laugh at the kids and tell them that's ridiculous and that they should just leave her house and stop harassing the poor old lady. The kids stare at you before realizing
            that they have an opportunity to escape and run for freedom. You help granny to her living room where she is distraught insisting she has no idea who those kids were, or how
            they got into her house. You sigh, and comfort her until she falls asleep where you then return home, and go to bed yourself.

        FIGHT:
        Character immediately attacks kids, combat mechanic occurs, kids attack as one entity however each with low stats but added are quite strong
        Character will kill the children, however in the process drop the basket causing the fruit to fall on the floor and get stepped on so granny now has no food to eat
        in return granny will turn to the character

        *GRANNY IS NOW THE VILLAIN*

        With no food to eat now that her dinner is dead, and you dropped the gifts from your mother granny turns to you. You begin to back up slightly realizing that she intends to 
        eat you now. That maybe you shouldn't have killed those kids and they were defending themselves. Her eyes glow red as you tremble in fear. Do you "Run", try to "talk" your way
        out of this, or "fight" your own granny?

        IF RUN:
            
            You begin to start running home as fast as you can. Nothing on your mind but surviving.

            *INSERT AGILITY ROLL*

            IF WIN
                
                You run until you've made it home, and begin to try explaining what happened to your mother. She rolls her eyes however and simply tells you to stop lying. When you 
                insist that you're being truthful she sends you to your room and says that you're no longer allowed to explore as it's given you crazy ideas.

                *GAME END*
            
            IF LOSS

                look in her eyes and steps in, throwing a knife at her, causing granny to scream out before she crumpled to the ground. Therefore saving you.

        TALK:
        
            You begin to try and reason with granny. You beg for her to just let you go home, and that this can be your littel secret, you won't tell a soul. As far as your mother knows
